Completely restriction-free Google reviews and rating as Shortcode/Widget. Extensive display options; delicious themes; includes Structured Data.

== Description ==

Promote your Google reviews and rating from your *Google My Business* listing – with current customer reviews and the overall rating loading from within your website

This plugin will collect your location’s data using Google’s Place ID; transforming this information into a well-formatted list or blocks of reviews. You’ll be able to add links to the Google reviews, your Google Maps listing, plus direct your customers to post their reviews and ratings with Google. Don’t worry: there are no restrictions to the reviews collection and plenty of options to display it perfectly on your website.

= Easy and secure integration direct from Google =

This Google reviews plugin is the perfect tool for businesses looking to showcase their customer reviews and ratings fully-loaded right on their website.

One of the many standout features of the plugin is its easy setup and integration with reviews posted to Google My Business using Google’s Places API. You will be able to quickly and easily display your business’s ratings and reviews on your website. A fully automated process keeps the overall rating accurate and over time maintains and builds the catalog of customer reviews.

= Highly customizable with an extensive selection of designs =

Whether you prefer lists, carousels, columns, or tiles… it’s all covered. A great feature of the plugin is the customizable designs – currently 150 variations with light and dark versions and 14 color schemes.

All aspects of the summary can be selected as with each review item. There’s even the author’s name and date formatting for good measure!

You can choose from an extensive range of templates to display their reviews and ratings in a way that fits your website design. The styling has a light touch so you can also customize the templates to match your brand style and preferences.

= Unconstrained filtering of reviews =

The plugin also allows businesses to sort and filter reviews by all elements of the review including its star rating. Star rating filtering means a business can choose to display only its most positive reviews or, for a transparent approach, all reviews, regardless of their rating. Apply your desire for similar-length reviews, include or exclude reviews by their word content, cached shuffled reviews, and more – everything you’ll need, it’s all there.

= A fully responsive design =

The plugin is designed to be fully responsive, which means that it will look great on all devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This is an important feature for businesses that want to ensure that their customer reviews and ratings are easily accessible to all visitors and deliver on the highest SEO demands.

= Regularly updated and feedback-driven development =

This plugin is regularly updated to ensure that it is always up-to-date and working with the latest version of WordPress and edge PHP releases. This means that businesses can rest assured that their customer reviews and ratings will be displayed correctly and accurately, without any technical issues.

We really listen to user feedback and any good suggestions will be considered and implemented in new releases. As documented in our plugin reviews, support is second-to-none, surpassing what you’d expect from paid support with premium plugins.

= Free, powerful and reliable =

So, get this Google reviews plugin for a powerful and versatile way to showcase your customer reviews and ratings on your website. With its easy integration with the Places API, numerous customizable designs, extensive sorting and filtering, excellent shortcode support, responsive design, free to use, Structured Data/Schema and fully maintained. This plugin is the perfect tool for any business looking to build trust and credibility with its customers.

== Requirements: ==

*   A free [Google API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and a [Place ID](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id). Specific locations are supported; coverage areas are no longer offering data through the API.
*   A [Google Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to receive your *substantial and free* API Request allocation.

== Recommendations: ==

*   Please [set your business in Google](https://business.google.com) and find your Business’ [Place ID](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id) before using this plugin.
*   For peace of mind, please set [Google Places API Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/apis/places-backend.googleapis.com/quotas) to keep requests below the billable threshold. The recommended value for requests is 100 per day.

*This is my first public plugin, so [all comments](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/gmbrr/) are very welcome. I would also like to see your usage so I can introduce new themes. There is a sister plugin: [We’re Open!](https://wordpress.org/plugins/opening-hours/) which retrieves current opening hours from Google My Business.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/g-business-reviews-rating` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
3. Use the **Settings**→**Reviews and Rating – Google My Business** screen to configure the plugin with your [Google API Key](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/gmbrr/#api-key) and the business’ [Place ID](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id). Here is a copy of the same instructions:
4. Once the Google credentials are all set, shortcodes will be available to place in any page, post or use the widget


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Google API Key? =

All the details for collecting your Google API Key can be found at [our visual guide to creating a Google API Key](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/gmbrr/#api-key).

Once your *Project* is set, you will need a new *API Key* with access to the **Places API**. As a restriction, set your host’s **IP Address** (not your website’s URL). Details of this value are listed on the Settings→Reviews and Rating page.

The Google API is required for this plugin to load the data from the Google API.

= How do I find my Place ID? =

You can locate your unique *Place ID* using Google’s: [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id)

= I have more than 5 reviews, why can I only see 5 in this plugin? =

The Google API only offers a maximum of 5 relevant or recent reviews at a time. Fortunately, this plugin will collect more reviews over time giving you more options to display your selection of reviews from a larger pool. If you feel comfortable with the *HTML Inspector* in your browser, you can import all the reviews showing in the Google reviews popup.

= Why can’t I see any reviews on the website? =

Your first place to check is the *Retrieved Data* tab in Dashboard→Settings. If there is an error here, follow the advice offered by the Google API. If you can see some reviews listed, check for restrictions in your settings or Shortcode that may limit the results. You can use the parameter: *errors=1* to report back potential issues in the front-end.

= I retrieved some reviews, but now an error message is asking for an “active billing account”. What can I do to see my reviews again? =

To use this plugin over time, you’ll need multiple requests to the Place API. Accounts without billing details have a tiny initial allocation. So, please [enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/billing/enable) to receive your substantial and free API request allocation.

= Why does this require a Google Billing Account if it’s free? =

The link to a [Google Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/billing/enable) is Google’s way of preventing overuse of its APIs – prolific users will be billed according. Fortunately, this plugin will use a tiny fraction of your inclusive free allowance; so it is free to use.

= Can I limit my API requests to keep this within my free allowance? =

This plugin will only use a fraction of your free allowance. However, for peace of mind, you can limit the request to ensure it stays within your free allowance. Just go to [Google Maps Platform: Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/quotas); select Places API from the dropdown at the top; in the first Requests section, set the “Requests per day” to 100 and click Save.

= Getting my own Google API is annoying; can’t I just load my reviews from somewhere else? =

This is possible; however it would involve sharing your data with a third-party provider. We believe that it is much better to source your reviews direct from Google. Additionally, relying on anyone other than Google will result in slower updates and/or fewer reviews with the possibility of being cut-off their service goes down or if they decide to limit their service to reduce costs.

= When setting up the Google API Credentials, I cannot see Places API listed. Where is it? =

Some people don’t appear to have the Places API enabled in their account. Go to your [Places API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/places-backend.googleapis.com?q=place) and click to Enable this API.

= How many locations can I add to this plugin? =

You can add as many as you wish. However, only the current location will be updated at the frequency you’ve set within the Settings. There is a Shortcode parameter: *place_id* will load reviews and other data from a previously set location. A new premium plugin is in development that will offer comprehensive management of multiple locations. So if this is of interest, please [get in touch](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/gmbrr/) and we’ll notify you when this is available.

= I can see my reviews in Google, but nothing is appearing in the plugin. The Google API and Place ID are valid. What is happening? =

Google does not send data for all places; only those currently found using the [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id). Some people who have service or coverage areas that aren’t a specific area may receive an error message: Not Found when attempting to retrieve data. This may occur after a period of time has passed. Unfortunately, there is nothing to remedy this issue for the time being other than to ensure your business uses a specific location as its Place ID.

= My reviews are no longer updating. What can I do to retrieve new reviews?

This could occur if your billing details become outdated or something else has changed that has disrupted the flow of new data. Please check your billing details are current in your [Google Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/billing/enable).

If you’re seeing either a vague error message (or no error message at all), please try enabling: Clean Retrieved Data in the Setup tab and then Clear Cache in the Advanced tab.

= I don’t have any reviews yet, how can I develop my new website without any data to preview? =

There’s a demo mode that will populate some reviews for you and allow for testing prior to going live.

= I want to load a compressed version of the script and/or CSS, is this possible? =

You can select to load the standard or minified versions of the JavaScript and style sheet files or opt to avoid loading either/both of these.

= Is this plugin GDPR compliant? =

Yes. The customer ratings and reviews are collected directly by your web server from Google Cloud using the Places API. No customer data is shared at any point in this process. Similarly, the HTML Import process processes the same publicly available content from Google’s review listing.

If you are concerned about loading either the business icon or avatar images through Google’s CDN, you can choose to use [locally hosted images](https://demo.designextreme.com/reviews-rating-google-business/#columns) in their place or hide these altogether.

= Where can I find some examples of the Shortcodes? =

There’s a comprehensive list in the Shortcodes tab in Dashboard→Settings. To view a showcase of many of these Shortcodes with various parameters and some suggestions for CSS, please have a look at our [Demonstration Website](https://demo.designextreme.com/reviews-rating-google-business/).
